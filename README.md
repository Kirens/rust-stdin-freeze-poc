# Cargo build script regression
It seems build scripts are executed differently in cargo 1.62.1 and 1.63.0 that I couldn't find an explanation for it in the [changelog](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) or [rust changelog](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1630-2022-08-11).

## Demo
For convenience, there's a trivial `docker-compose.yaml` to compare the different versions. Simply run:
```sh
docker-compose up
```

We're expecting 1.62 to compile and shut down properly, while 1.63 freezes. Outputting something like:
```

## Background
In the older versions the build script seems to be run with a terminated _stdin_, while not in the newer versions.

A package I'm using tries to determine if an executable is available by running it in the build script.
(This might be badly designed, but that's beside the point)
With a terminated _stdin_, the executable simply exits.
But in the newer versions it waits for input, preventing the build script and hence the compilation from ever terminating.
